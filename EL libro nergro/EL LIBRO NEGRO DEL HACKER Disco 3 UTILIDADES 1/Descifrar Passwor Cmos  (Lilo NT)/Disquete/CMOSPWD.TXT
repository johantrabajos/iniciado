Platforms
- Dos-Windows version
Well, ... it works!

- Linux version
Users can work on cmos backup but they need root priviledge to
use ioperm function to have full access to cmos.

- Windows NT
Users can work on cmos backup. To work on cmos memory, gwiopm need to be
installed and running.
gwiopm gives direct port I/O access for specified ports to user-mode process
(ring 3) using Ke386SetIoAccessMap and Ke386IoSetAccessProcess kernel functions.
You need administrator priviledges to install this driver
"instdrv gwiopm c:\tmp\gwiopm.sys"
To remove the driver, run "instdrv gwiopm remove".


Divers
- Award 4.50PG
There is an universal password AWARD_SW.
(d8on, 589589 ... works too)
- Award
Differents passwords give the same 32-bit CRC, so CmosPwd can only give one
of them. Use the numeric keypad.
- COMPAQ LTE 5300 notebook
Tolga Sinan Guney: there is a reset jumper on the motherboard
- DIGITAL PC300, Phoenix 4.0 Rel 6.0,0
Rene Pocisk: cmospwd /k works
- DELL Latitude CPi 233ST Notebook
Ole Jensen: passwords are stored in EEPROM
- DELL Latitude CPi D266XT
Robert Rafai: Passwords are stored in an eeprom (24c02).
To remove the password,
  - clear the cmos
  - flash your BIOS: get the file on internet and use an eeprom programmer
  - store 00 00 ... on the eeprom 24c02
- Fujitsu ICL
aksion: passwords are stored in EEPROM
- Hewlett Packard
Passwords are often (always) stored in EEPROM
There are reset jumper on some models
- Phoenix
There is a backdoor in old version of Phoenix BIOS, the universal
password is "phoenix".
- Toshiba
Differents passwords give the same 32-bit CRC, so CmosPwd can only give one
of them.
- IBM Thinkpad Setup password
TP 770:  Get eeprom 24c01 contents and run cmospwd on this file.
TP 765D: Read eeprom 93c46
- Siemens Nixdorf PCD-4ND
Michael: You can clear the password of this phoenix 1.03 with "cmospwd /k"


What to do if you can't use cmospwd to clear your cmos ?
You can use debug to reset cmos CRC stored at 0x2E-0x2F
debug
-o 70 2E
-o 71 0
-q


 
What to do if cmospwd don't work on your PC ?

Try to clear password with cmospwd /k.
If cmospwd /k doesn't work, password is stored in an EEPROM. Try to find a
reset jumper on your motherboard or contact your PC vendor.
If it works, I can try to discover how passwords are encrypted.
I need to know what Bios you used and
some cmos memory backup with their passwords. (cmospwd /w backupfile)
For passwords, choose
some 1 and 2-letter passwords
