Ultra Zip Password Cracker: versions history
============================================
! Bug fixed
+ New feature/modification

Oct, 21 1999 v3.61
------------------
  ! Cannot open some PowerZip's archives which contains zero length files
    (for example, directory structure is a zero length file)
  ! Passwords sometimes incorrectly shows (passwords mix up)
  ! Crashed when opening some self-extracting archive
  ! Cannot decrypt self-extracting archives after plaintext attack
  ! Password recovering for some specific files

Aug, 1 1999 v3.60
-----------------
  ! Unregistered version may creates archives with no valid files at all when
    using "known-plaintext" attack
  ! Incorrectly handled command line (cannot run UZPC with status file as
    parameter)
  ! Corrected our web page address
  + Brute-force attack with 3 or more files now ~20% faster (at PII)
  + Support for some "strange" (with undocumented features) zip archives

Jul, 7  1999 v3.50
------------------
  ! Crashed when selecting "template" attack after successful "brute-force" one
  ! Minor corrections
  + "Known plaintext" attack now about 25 times faster ;)
  + Interface modifications
  + All documentations moved to windows help file

May, 20 1999 v3.00
------------------
  ! Incorrectly opened template attack status files
  ! Crashed when selecting non-existing file as "plaintext"
  + "Get current task info" feature.

May, 9 1999 v3.00 beta 3
------------------------
  ! Brute-force: doesn't find passwords which ends with second letter in
    charset (B if charset is capital letters, 1 if charset is digits, etc)
  ! Incorrectly checks some files (and so doesn't find passwords for them)
    if file was deflated with very small ratio (final fix for this bug, I hope)
  + Ability to change task priority
  + Speed optimisations when only one file available

Apr, 10 1999 v3.00 beta 2
-------------------------
  + "Known plaintext" attack now supported
  + CREATORNAME field in uzpc.lng file

Apr, 4 1999 v3.00 beta 1
------------------------
  + Brute-force: cracking routine totally rewritten. You can expect about
    200-230% speed increment at modern CPUs (PII/III/Celeron & K6-2/III)
  + Optimized internal file structure (this means nothing but file size
    decreasing)
  + Changed "About" dialog box
  + Documentation for "template attack"

Apr, 2 1999 v2.03
------------------
  ! Some small corrections
  + Brute-force: speed increment for some CPUs (+20% on K6 and nothing on
    iP-133)
  + Ability to minimize to tray

Feb, 23 1999 v2.02
------------------
 !! Fixed very serious bug. Previous versions of UZPC may not crack some
    archives. It may happens if attacked file was large (greater then 300-500K)
    and was deflated with very small ratio (1%), i.e. attacked file was already
    compressed with another utility.

  + Template attack: mix of brute-force and dictionary based

  + Shows current status when minimized
  + Ability to stop and save separately
  + Dictionary based: shows current percent of processed lines
  + Changed registration numbers

Dec, 22 1998 v1.11
