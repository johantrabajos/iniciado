    Ultra Zip Password Cracker v3.61
========================================
  This program may help you to recover a
password for zip archive. Program highly
optimized  for speed (about 95  millions
passwords  per  minute at modern 300 Mhz
system), has nice GUI and very small. It
works with  archives that contains  only
one  file and  works with  archives that
contains files with different passwords.
  Program supports four types of attack:
brute-force (you can  define minimum and
maximum  password length  and characters
used in password), dictionary based (you
can  define  how to  modify  words  from
dictionary  file),  mix  of  brute-force
and  dictionary  based  called  template
attack (if  you're know  something about
password you can really recover it) and,
finally,  "known  plaintext" attack - if
you  have one  non-encrypted  file  from
encrypted archive you're need only 10-20
min. to recover all files from archive.
